SUMMARY: Computational analyses of microbial genomes through genomic sequencing hold tremendous promise yet can become riddled with various sources of potential bias. The microbial genome analysis workshop is designed for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators from diverse backgrounds and interests for clarity on how to effectively utilize ubiquitous computational pipelines for answering specific research questions. This hands-on workshop will cover end-to-end microbial genome analysis, discussing the pros and cons of decisions made during the process (library preparation, sequencing, bioinformatic tool selection, parameter settings, and interpretation of results).

TOPICS: Short and long-read sequencing, amplicon and isolate genome sequence, genome assembly and validation, functional annotation, phylogenomic analysis, and strain typing. This workshop will be taught by scientists with expertise in bioinformatics and analysis of clinical samples, allowing participants to get individualized training on how to accurately sample, sequence, and characterize microbial genomes.

I am trained as an epidemiologist and have extensive experience in applying advanced genomic technologies and big-data analytical methods to investigate infectious diseases of public health importance. I am also an Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, within the McGovern School of Medicine, and serve as the Associate Director for Microbial Genomics in the Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG). My laboratory uses a combination of existing and innovative laboratory techniques, and cutting-edge sequencing and bioinformatics to study infectious disease transmission and colonization, how microbial communities impact the development of disease, and how antimicrobial resistance develops and transmits through society. Current projects include: elucidating the importance of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in clinical outcomes, such as patient mortality and response to treatment, in Staphylococcus aureus causing bacteremia, co-circulating strains of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE); and interrogating the role of the microbiome in implanted medical device-associated infections, with a specific focus on breast implants placed following mastectomy due to cancer.

### Session 4
#### Dr. Will Shropshire, PhD

<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/treangenlab/radmicrobes/assets/28576450/62d34750-c510-4993-9220-ee3b5de6cd37">

William Shropshire is an Instructor, research faculty at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center within the Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health. He is a previous Gulf Coast Consortia/Keck Centerâ€™s Texas Medical Center Training Program in Antimicrobial Resistance (NIAID Grant No. T32 AI141349-05) T32 Postdoctoral Fellow. During the past seven years, Dr. Shropshire has developed a strong skillset in computational biology and microbiology with the focus of his work translating genomic data into clinically impactful results. His pre- and post-doctoral work has spanned a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance to the genomic epidemiology of infectious disease outbreaks. The focus of his previous T32 work was to elucidate genomic and transcriptomic factors that contribute to the progressive development of carbapenem resistance within *Escherichia coli* causing invasive infections. Over the past four years, his research has documented the significant clinical impact of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Enterobacterales and how ESBL encoding genes can amplify via mobile genetic elements upon initial exposures to beta-lactam drugs. There is increasing evidence that these beta-lactamase gene encoding amplifications can lead to heteroresistant populations, wherein only a subset of a bacterial population remains non-susceptible to treatment. He recently submitted a K01 application in which he proposes to investigate clinical and microbiological factors contributing to recurrent, racalcitrant Enterobacterales infections, including characterizing how AMR survival srategies such as heteroresistance and tolerance contribute to recurrence. His research work can be summarized [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Shropshire).
